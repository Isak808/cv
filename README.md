# Information architecture & Visual design
This document is designed with two columns that intersperse information about the employee. The left column is more focused in the qualities skills of this person and the right is their formal education and experience in this field. The languages are shown with a bar showing the fluency and the skills are shown in 4 different categories: general, programming languages, database management and web development, making it easy to add new categories and skills in the future. \n
The CV has two gray shades as the two main colors (#CCCCCC and #343a42) of the background and the colored titles seek to stand out from other similar looking CVs and grab the attention of the employer. The font is a standard font that should work in most browsers.
